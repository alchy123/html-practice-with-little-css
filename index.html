          <span class="example"
            >The two most popular science courses offered by the school are
            <b class="term">chemistry</b> (the study of chemicals and the
            composition of substances) and <b class="term">physics</b> (the
            study of the nature and properties of matter and energy).</span
          ><br />
          The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the
          element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special
          importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most
          browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use
          b for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create
          boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you
          wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use
          the strong element.
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>Usage Notes for b element:</span><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the b element for cases like keywords in a summary, product
            names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation
            would be boldfaces (but not including any special importance).
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not confuse the b element with the strong, em or mark elements.
            The strong element represents text of certain importance, em puts
            some emphasis on the text and the mark element represents text of
            certain relevance. The b element doesn't convey such special
            semantic information;
            <strong>use it only when no others fit.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the b element. For
            this purpose, use the h1 to h6 tags. Further, stylesheets can change
            the default style of these elements, with the result that they are
            not necessarily displayed in bold.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the b element in
            order to convey additional semantic information as needed (for
            example creating a b element with a class like "lead" for the first
            sentence in a paragraph). This makes it easier to manage multiple
            use cases of b if your stylistic needs change, without the need to
            change all of its uses in the HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Historically, the b element was meant to make text boldface. Styling
            information has been deprecated since HTML4, so the meaning of the b
            element has been changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is no semantic purpose to using the b element, you should
            use the CSS font-weight property with the value "bold" instead in
            order to make text bold.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        <span class="example"
          >Before proceeding,
          <strong>make sure you put on your safety goggles</strong>.</span
        ><br />
        The strong element is for content that is of "strong importance,"
        including things of great seriousness or urgency (such as warnings).
        This could be a sentence that is of great importance to the whole page,
        or you could merely try to point out that some words are of greater
        importance compared to nearby content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="example"
          >The term <i>bandwidth</i> describes the measure of how much
          information can pass through a data connection in a given amount of
          time.</span
        ><br />
        The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the
        normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms,
        taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been
        presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i
        naming of this element.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="example" id="bookmark1"
          >We <em>had</em> to do something about it.</span
        ><br />
        The em element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to
        surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a
        sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="example"
          ><small

          ></span
        >
        <br />
        The small HTML element represents side-comments and small print, like
        copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By
        default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from
        small to x-small.

        The blockquote HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an
        extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation
        (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation
        may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of
        the source can be given using the cite element.

      CSS Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element
      will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set
      the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other
      text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you
      specify something else)!

      Note! Use css style while setting the width and height of an image instead
      of attribute ones. This way, css can't override because you already write

      We have a goal that we are trying to do with
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. We are trying to create a
      table with rounded white borders. But when we use border-collapse:collapse
      with the border-radius property, we failed and border-radius did not
      worked.<br /><br />
      For this reason, we created the borders and give border-radius just to the
      table element. Therefore we couldn't create borders for all corners with
      the border property for the th and td elements because borders were being
      double without the collapse. And when we use collapse it overrides the
      border-radius.<br /><br />
      Thus we create the borders with the single border properties like
      border-right and border-bottom. It worked then we gived a smooth color to
      the borders compatible with the table's background color.<br /><br />
      Trick was using the :last-child
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> pseudo-class and destroy
      the repeated borders for the same area.

          In HTML, attributes are <strong>explicitly bound</strong> to specific

        <li>
          In CSS, properties are <strong>not hard-wired to HTML elements</strong> like HTML attributes are. Instead, each CSS property is defined in its own specification with an <q>Applies to</q> rule. That rule describes the kind of boxes or element roles the property can affect - not the tag names.
